Qt Line
=======
Small C++ and Qt application to draw lines without using an already implemented
algorithm

Compilation (tested only on linux)
==================================
 1. `cd` into the application's directory
 2. `qmake`
 3. `make`

Usage
=====
After compiling the application just run `./qt-line` and click on the scene to
draw lines.

The first left click sets the starting point of a line and the second left click
sets the ending point of a line, the process may be repeated many times.

Right click clears the scene.
